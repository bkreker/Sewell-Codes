Programming projects written and used in capacity of Online Advertising Coordinator at Sewell Direct.

Mostly AdWords Scripts, some SQL queries, some Misc docs.

Many of the AdWords Scripts were originally from templates, but have since been thoroughly customized to fit my purposes. 
The SQL Queries are just some of the queries I use with my Access database for automation of my reporting, which I've saved as backup measures.
