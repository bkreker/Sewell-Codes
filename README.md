# work-scripts

Mostly AdWords Scripts, some SQL queries, some misc docs.

Programming projects written and used by Josh DeGraw in capacity of Online Advertising Coordinator at Sewell Direct, mainly for automating certain processes and reports within AdWords.


Many of the AdWords Scripts were originally from templates found online, but have since been thoroughly customized to fit my purposes. I started originally with practically no coding experience, aside from some lessons on Kahn academy, so much of this repo came from learning as I've been going.
